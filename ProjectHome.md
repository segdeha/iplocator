# IP Locator #

## What it is ##

IP Locator is a Mac OS X Dashboard widget that returns geolocation information for a given IP address

## How you can help ##

Get involved with IP Locator! I am open-sourcing this widget because I plan to get it working with the open HostIP.com API rather than the old DNSStuff.com service (which no longer works).

The list of tasks to get this widget to the next version is pretty small. Where I could use help is with localizations.
